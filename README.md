# Project Goal
----------------------------------

**For this project we are building a model that can predict the main programming language of a repository, given the text of the README file. We will use 100 different README files from repositories available on GitHub, and use Natural Language Processing on the text within to build our model.**



# Initial Questions
---------------------------------

- one

- two

- three

- four

- five?


# Project Planning
---------------------------------
**Plan -> Acquire -> Prepare -> Explore -> Deliver Planning:**

- Create a README file

   - Ensure my dataprep modules are well documents and functional

- Acquisition

   - Obtain labor.csv from US Department of Labor database via https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/labor/

- Preparation

   - Clean data
   - Feature Engineer additional columns

- Exploration

   - Ask and answer questions about the labor data.
   - Visually represent findings with charts.
